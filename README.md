# Hello everyone!👋 I'm Roy 😁
# I'm a Korean Node.js Developer. 👨‍💻

The reason why I opened the github page is that I have felt limited in using the library while working on the project so far and to contribute to the ecosystem through my activities.

I hope my activities will help many people.
Of course, in the Javascript ecosystem too :) 

## This is my language experiences. 
- [Node.js] - Experienced in production and deployment
- [React.js] - Experienced in production and deployment
- [Nest.js] - Experienced in production and deployment
- [Swift] - Interested area but no production experience yet.
